# Contributing

To add a new repository to the list, find the appropriate section for
the repository's language and add a new entry like this:

    * (https://github.com/username/repo)

Save the file and then run `./scripts/add-badges.py` on the command
line and then commit your changes.

Adding your own repos is perfectly fine, but don't add the same repo
to multiple sections.  If you use multiple languages, then you should
add your repo to the "Polyglot" section.

Repositories not hosted on GitHub are fine, but they won't have a
"last commit" badge.
